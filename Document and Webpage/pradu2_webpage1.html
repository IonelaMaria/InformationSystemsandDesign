<P>

Based in the future during the year 2154, the Earth is was so over populated that the planet was split into two different divisions
of people. There is the wealthy colony that travels the Earth's orbit in a life breading man-made space station called, <I>Elysium</I>. 
Then there are the abandoned people left on Earth's, dried up and overpopulated surface who are left in poverty to strive for their lives 
and stuggle in the wastelands known as their home. As illegals try to pass through <I>Elysium's</I> government border the Secretary, 
Delacourt will stop at nothing to enforce the stations anti-immigrations laws to uphold this blissful artifical strucutre. But the forsaken
people of Earth will take any risk they can to seek the benefits of this utopia and now that Max's life is in grave danger he will do
whatever it takes to save himself and the planet, including making a deal that can easily be compared to one with the devil. This daunting 
mission will attempt to arrange these polar opposite worlds to something that many people have wished for years, equality.
